Daten.Cafe wants to provide basic knowledge in data literacy in a simple way. Free access to the application and the results form the basis for this. The application allows learning and practicing the concepts also on (modern) smartphones and tablets. Data literacy means being able to understand and deal with data. Using data in different contexts helps to make informed decisions.
