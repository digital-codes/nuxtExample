**How to Talk About Politics with an Environmental Chatbot**

Have you ever talked to a tree?

The "chatty plane tree" is a project that shows how artificial intelligence can be used to explore and interact with the environment. In conversation with the environmental chatbot, familiar — and sometimes surprising — perspectives on environmental and climate protection emerge. With a wink, we ask how non-human actors can be involved in social or political debates.

In the workshop we jointly develop system inputs, so‑called prompts, for a "chatty plane tree" and experiment live with different role stereotypes — from the humorous street tree to the pragmatic urbanist to the angry environmental activist. We will pursue questions such as: Can a tree chatbot represent interests at all — and if so, whose? What concrete information (so‑called domain knowledge) does an AI need to provide informed answers? What stories can such a project tell? How can new ideas and narratives be introduced? And how can the perspectives of a non‑human stakeholder be meaningfully integrated into political discussions?

Afterwards we will discuss urban greenery in Karlsruhe together. The workshop findings — and the question of how the plane tree chatbot can be constructively introduced into a political debate — will be explored further in that conversation.
