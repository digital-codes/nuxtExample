The *Open Data Day* on the first Saturday in March is an annual event to raise international awareness about the importance of open data.

Around this day of action, local groups around the world organize self-run events—including in Karlsruhe.
This year’s overarching theme is *Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) with Open Data*.

This year, together with partners from Karlsruhe, we can offer a more extensive program than before, focusing on opportunities for participation: the HackDays **Open Data for Urban Future**.

Is this only for *hackers* or IT professionals? **Not at all!** We follow the [Wikipedia definition](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack) and want to use creative methods to improve things that don’t work so well yet. Good ideas are needed not only from programmers and data experts.

Regardless of age or technical skills—everyone can participate in the *Open Data Day*, whether you’re a newcomer or an expert.

## Workshops
Not typical for a hackathon, but perhaps a good idea: If you have little time, our "Hands-on" sessions offer information on data-related topics. Each lasts a maximum of 1 hour. Just drop by and join in (if there’s still space). Here’s the link to

### Results

We have created a [**video**](https://youtu.be/lFcIXbp3C3Y) of the final presentations.

## Schedule

We’ll kick off the *Open Data HackDays* at 5:00 PM in the **[Triangel Space](https://www.triangel.space/)** with an introduction. On Saturday, the rooms will be available from 10:00 AM for our hacks. From 6:00 PM, we’ll review the results together.

**Refreshments are provided: drinks, fruit, and snacks are available both days, plus lunch on Saturday.**

To promote sustainability, we will set up a monthly meeting for the projects created during the event.
